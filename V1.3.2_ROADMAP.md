# SimpleOS v1.3.2 - Fork & Exec Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ Sprint Goals

Building on the complete syscall infrastructure from v1.3.1, v1.3.2 focuses on implementing the core process creation and execution syscalls that enable true multitasking.

### ðŸš€ Primary Objectives

1. **Implement fork() System Call**
   - Process duplication with copy-on-write semantics
   - Parent/child process relationship management
   - Memory space cloning and isolation
   - Register state preservation and PID assignment

2. **Implement exec() System Call Family**
   - Program loading and execution (execve, execvp, etc.)
   - Address space replacement
   - Environment and argument passing
   - ELF binary format support (basic)

3. **Enhanced Process Management**
   - Parent-child process trees
   - Process state synchronization
   - Exit status handling
   - Orphan and zombie process management

### ðŸ“‹ Detailed Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement
- [ ] Extend process control blocks (PCB) for parent-child relationships
- [ ] Implement process tree data structures
- [ ] Add copy-on-write memory management support
- [ ] Create process cloning utilities

#### Phase 2: fork() Implementation
- [ ] Design fork() syscall interface
- [ ] Implement memory space duplication
- [ ] Handle register state preservation
- [ ] Add PID allocation for child processes
- [ ] Test parent-child process creation

#### Phase 3: exec() Implementation  
- [ ] Design exec() syscall family interface
- [ ] Implement basic ELF loader
- [ ] Add address space replacement logic
- [ ] Handle argument and environment passing
- [ ] Test program execution scenarios

#### Phase 4: Process Synchronization
- [ ] Implement wait() and waitpid() syscalls
- [ ] Add exit status collection
- [ ] Handle zombie process cleanup
- [ ] Test process lifecycle management

### ðŸ”§ Technical Challenges

1. **Memory Management Complexity**
   - Copy-on-write implementation
   - Address space isolation
   - Efficient memory cloning

2. **Process State Management**
   - Register context preservation
   - File descriptor inheritance
   - Signal handling inheritance

3. **Binary Loading**
   - ELF format parsing
   - Dynamic loading support
   - Memory layout management

### ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Individual syscall functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Parent-child process interactions
- **Stress Tests**: Multiple fork/exec scenarios
- **Compatibility Tests**: POSIX compliance validation

### ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

- [ ] `fork()` creates functional child processes
- [ ] `exec()` successfully loads and runs programs
- [ ] Parent-child process relationships work correctly
- [ ] Process synchronization (wait/exit) functions properly
- [ ] No memory leaks or corruption during process operations
- [ ] Full integration with existing syscall infrastructure

### ðŸ“ˆ Expected Outcomes

Upon completion of v1.3.2, SimpleOS will have:
- Complete process creation and execution capabilities
- POSIX-compatible process management
- Foundation for advanced multitasking
- Ready for shell and application development
